# Turning the Page with SwiftUI
This tutorial will walk you through creating a simple SwiftUI project that demonstrates paging tab views and basic property wrappers.  This tutorial is ideal for developers who have basic familiarity with Swift, GitHub, and Xcode, but are new to SwiftUI. 

The main branch has the starter project.  The completed project can be found in the [tutorial/completed](https://github.com/CrystalKnightCodes/swiftui-paging-tabs/tree/tutorial/completed) branch.
